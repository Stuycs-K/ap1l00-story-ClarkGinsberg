Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on it, I thought I would <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> about
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the clock. It is a way I have of driving off the
dogs and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the cats;
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my house; whenever I find myself involuntarily
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> before coffin cat, and bringing up the rear of every dog I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> into the building, and methodically
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> people's cats off—then, I account it high time to get to people as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all dogs in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the cats with me.
